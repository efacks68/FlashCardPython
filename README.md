# FlashCardPython
This program will make a flash card application. It will pull from the spreadsheet "languages.csv" where I have made a list of words in English with their Spanish and Norwegian translation. The program will randomly select an index for a random word and display the word. There will be buttons for displaying the other language translations. Pressing them will reveal that languages' translation. It will cycle through the words in a random order, excluding the ones that have already gone. Later developments can include an option to type in the word for each language and check them
